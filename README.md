# Project Title

Exploring New York City's Dirties Restaurants

Description

Understanding the violation problem of New York City's restaurant. It uses the dataset inspection by the Deparment of Health and Mental Hygiene. I was able to clean the data using python. Then, I could plot five types of figures using plotly and show two scattermapbox, one choroplet map, one barchar and one scatterbox. Also, I could add a search bar where users can type their favorite restaurant and print a table and they can see the violations the their favorite restaurant has And lastly, I used the library Dash to create this site
