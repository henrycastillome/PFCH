# Project Title

Exploring New York City's Dirties Restaurants

## Description

Understanding the violation problem of New York City's restaurant. I used the dataset inspection by the Deparment of Health and Mental Hygiene. I was able to clean the data using python. Then, I could plot five types of figures using plotly and show two scattermapbox, one choroplet map, one barchar and one scatterbox. Also, I could add a search bar where users can type their favorite restaurant and print a table and they can see the violations the their favorite restaurant has. And lastly, I used the library Dash to create this site
